In addition to\n        identifying the problem, I think it’s crucial to understand how Puerto\n        Rico became at risk of gentrification to address it. Under former Puerto\n        Rican governor Luis Fortuño, two controversial acts, Act 22 and Act 60,\n        were passed that encouraged wealthy foreigners to move to Puerto Rico\n        through tax incentives. The government has been unsuccessful in ensuring\n        new residents meet the requirements in exchange for tax incentives,\n        allowing foreigners to take advantage of the two acts.\n      </div>\n      <h2 className=\"header\">Methodology</h2>\n      <div className=\"body\">\n        I went through the available tables on the United States Census Bureau’s\n        website to look for data tables under Puerto Rico that I thought would\n        be relevant to finding which municipalities are at risk of or already\n        gentrified. In total, I compiled nine tables from the census website\n        with data from 2021, including demographic and housing estimates, age\n        and sex, geographic mobility by selected characteristics, households and\n        families, educational attainment, mean income, demographic\n        characteristics of occupied housing units, financial characteristics,\n        physical housing characteristics, and race. After compiling and cleaning\n        the data, I considered the best approach to the problem. I initially\n        viewed unsupervised learning as the best way to approach the problem\n        since I didn’t have access to any labeled data. I chose the K Means\n        Clustering model and attempted to train it but found that the clusters\n        the model created seemed arbitrary and didn’t indicate any pattern.\n        After researching K Means Clustering, I discovered that the algorithm\n        struggles with high-dimensional data, making it unideal for my dataset.\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"body\">\n        To make K Means Clustering work, I reduced the number of tables used to\n        two and found the model was picking up on a pattern. I looked into the\n        categories the model created and noticed it was grouping the\n        municipalities with major cities together. It grouped San Juan, Ponce,\n        Caguas, and Bayamon. To verify these results, I looked at articles to\n        find some municipalities that are currently dealing with gentrification\n        and found that my model misclassified many municipalities dealing with\n        gentrification as not at risk. After experimenting with the parameters\n        and getting the same results back, I decided to experiment with the\n        algorithm. I went with the Spectral Clustering algorithm, which often\n        outperforms K Means Clustering. After training the model on both the\n        complete and subsets of the dataset, I found similar results to K Means\n        Clusters, where it would group all the municipalities with major cities.\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"body\">\n        After being unsuccessful with two unsupervised learning algorithms, I\n        assumed my only other option would be to use a supervised learning\n        algorithm. I researched which algorithm would work best if given a small\n        amount of labeled data. I came across the idea of semi-supervised\n        learning, a middle ground between unsupervised and supervised.\n        Semi-supervised learning, also known as weak supervision, can learn\n        using large amounts of unlabeled data paired with labeled data.\n        Semi-supervised learning circumvents some common issues associated with\n        getting a dataset for supervised learning, such as being expensive and\n        time-consuming. The approach requires less human oversight while still\n        benefiting from a higher accuracy.\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"body\">\n        To create a small amount of labeled data, I searched for articles and\n        personal posts about gentrifying parts of Puerto Rico. I found posts on\n        Reddit of users describing the gentrification they’re witnessing while\n        also categorizing the municipalities people moved to after being\n        displaced as less likely to be gentrified. After labeling a small subset\n        of data, I looked at the available unsupervised learning algorithms. I\n        decided to use the SelfTrainingClassifier from Scikit Learn, which is\n        based on Yarowsky’s algorithm and allows for a supervised classifier to\n        work like a semi-supervised classifier. According to Scikit Learn, “It\n        does this by iteratively predicting pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data\n        and adding them to the training set.” For my base supervised learning\n        algorithm to pair with the SelfTrainingClassifer, I used the Support\n        Vector Classification (SVC) algorithm.\n      </div>\n      <h2 className=\"header\">Results</h2>\n      <div className=\"body\">\n        After training the algorithm and creating a model to predict all\n        municipalities in Puerto Rico, it found that out of the 77\n        municipalities in Puerto Rico, all but 11 are classified as gentrifying\n        or at risk of gentrification. The following municipalities are\n        considered low risk for gentrification:\n      </div>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Bayamón </li>\n        <li>Caguas </li>\n        <li>Canóvanas </li>\n        <li>Carolina </li>\n        <li>Guaynabo </li>\n        <li>Gurabo </li>\n        <li>Juncos </li>\n        <li>Santa Isabel</li>\n        <li>Toa Alta</li>\n        <li>Toa Baja</li>\n        <li>Trujillo Alto</li>\n      </ul>\n      <div className=\"body\">\n        Below is a map of the results of the model’s prediction for every\n        municipality.\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"map\">\n        <ComposableMap\n          width={width}\n          height={height}\n          projectionConfig={{\n            scale: 16000,\n            center: [-66.25, 18],\n          }}\n          style={{\n            width: \"100%\",\n            height: \"auto\",\n          }}\n        >\n          <Geographies geography={JSON}>\n            {({ geographies }) =>\n              geographies.map((geo) => (\n                <Geography\n                  key={geo.rsmKey}\n                  geography={geo}\n                  fill={\n                    notAtRisk.includes(geo.properties.NAME) ? \"green\" : \"red\"\n                  }\n                  strokeWidth=\"1\"\n                  stroke=\"white\"\n                />\n              ))\n            }\n          </Geographies>\n        </ComposableMap>\n        <div className=\"legend\">\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"warning\"></div>\n            At risk of gentrification\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"row\">\n            <div className=\"safe\"></div>\n            Not at risk of gentrification\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <h2 className=\"header\">Future Research</h2>\n      <div className=\"body\">\n        To improve my project, I’d like to ensure the initial labels I used for\n        the SelfTrainingClassifier are as accurate as possible. For my initial\n        labels, I researched personal stories of individuals facing\n        gentrification in their neighborhoods. Although these stories are\n        helpful, there are plenty of other Puerto Ricans whose stories may not\n        have appeared in my research or had the opportunity to share their\n        story. To ensure my labeled data is more accurate, I’d like to work with\n        a sociologist or nonprofit that focuses on gentrification in Puerto Rico\n        to verify my initial labels and results. I’d also be interested in\n        conducting interviews with residents of affected municipalities or\n        conducting a survey to see how accurate my model is.\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"body\">\n        Another way I could improve my project would be by combining the data I\n        collected from the U.S. Census with housing data from Zillow or AirBnB.\n        One of the limitations of using census data is that it isn’t up to date\n        with current events. The data I collected is from 2021, so the status of\n        gentrification in Puerto Rico could look different now compared to back\n        then. Using current housing data could circumvent that issue.\n      </div>\n\n      <h2 className=\"header\">Resources</h2>\n      <div className=\"body\">\n        If you'd like to recreate my project,
